# A Standards-Based Review of Wearable and IoT Technologies in Parkinson's Telemedicine

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive review focused on identifying and categorizing interoperability and security standards relevant to wearable and IoT technologies in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) telemedicine. It aims to support secure data exchange, improve integration with clinical workflows, and highlight gaps and challenges in current real-world applications.

## Objective
- To examine existing standards supporting secure, interoperable data exchange for PD wearable technologies.  
- To identify gaps in security and clinical integration in the literature.  
- To illustrate real-world applications of these standards in Parkinson’s disease monitoring.

## Methods
- Conducted a systematic PubMed search retrieving 233 publications using Boolean logic.  
- Utilized large language models (LLMs) to filter and cluster 50 key articles.  
- Expanded to 63 sources by adding technical documents addressing underrepresented areas.  
- Organized findings into four thematic domains:  
  - **Security and Clinical Integration Standards** (e.g., IEEE/UL 2933, USCDI)  
  - **Communication and Data Exchange Standards** (e.g., IEEE 11073, HL7 FHIR)  
  - **Collaborative Development Programs** (e.g., WAMIII)  
  - **Implementation Frameworks and Guidelines** (e.g., Continua Design Guidelines)

## Key Findings
- **Security standards** like IEEE/UL 2933 are crucial but under-adopted by device manufacturers.  
- **Communication protocols** (e.g., IEEE 11073) improve data reliability and interoperability but face integration challenges.  
- **Collaborative initiatives** (e.g., WAMIII) have advanced standardization efforts but need broader coverage, especially for non-motor PD symptoms.  
- **Implementation frameworks** (e.g., HL7 FHIR) facilitate real-time clinical integration of wearable data.

## Discussion
Although many standards exist to ensure secure and interoperable telemedicine ecosystems for Parkinson’s Disease, widespread real-world adoption remains limited due to:  
- Fragmented device ecosystems  
- Technical barriers  
- Misalignment with clinical workflows  
- Lack of large-scale validation studies

Collaborative, patient-centered approaches and stronger regulatory support are needed to bridge these gaps.

## Conclusion
Standards like HL7 FHIR, IEEE/UL 2933, and the Continua Design Guidelines are critical to enabling remote patient monitoring and personalized care in Parkinson’s Disease management. Future research should focus on expanding empirical validations, facilitating broader manufacturer adoption, and building fully integrated telemedicine ecosystems.
